# Installing libvirtualdisk

## Prerequisites

The only requirements for building and installing libvirtualdisk are:

- A C++14 compatible compiler.
- Scons

So far,  the library has been built and tested on the Microsoft C++ compiler.

## Acquire source code

Before building, you need to retrieve the source code from Github. Use your favorite method to do this. It will also be
necessary to initialise the submodules in the "external" directory.

## Configuring

There are currently no selectable configuration options

## Building

- Navigate to the root folder of the library and execute "scons".

## Testing

There are no currently useful tests for the library.

## Installing

There isn't currently an automatic installation process. It will be necessary to manually copy the binary library file
and source code header files to your preferred location.
