# libvirtualdisk

Welcome. Libvirtualdisk aims to provide simple C++ classes that wrap various
virtual disk file formats. The long term goal is to allow the user to access
them as though they were regular iostreams, but for the time being simpler
classes will have to suffice.

Currently it is very much a work in progress.
